Our ([Infogr8](http://infogr8.com/)) project, [American Opportunity index](https://americanopportunityindex.com/) won [The Webby Award](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/employment/249474/the-american-opportunity-index) in the employment category.


That means, I can finally call myself an **Award winning project developer**.
