From technical point of view, we used :
<table>
<tr><th>Front End Hosting</th><td>Github Pages </td></tr>
<tr><th>Back End Hosting</th><td>Heroku </td></tr>
<tr><th>Front End Framework</th><td>Materializecss </td></tr>
<tr><th>Visualization</th><td>D3.js</td></tr>
<tr><th>Server  Side </th><td>Node.js</td></tr>
<tr><th>Database  </th><td>Mongodb / Google Spreadsheets </td></tr>
<tr><th>Data Analysis Platform</th><td>ObservableHQ </td></tr>
</table>



Website already was mentioned  by several major  news agencies  inside their articles and also some of the most popular televisions in the country ...



Though, most heartwarming things are the letters and words , I am getting from people, who found their ancestors using this platform .
