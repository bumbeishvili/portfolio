[The American Opportunity Index](https://americanopportunityindex.com/) is a Corporate Scorecard of Worker Advancement, a new effort to give companies and other stakeholders a set of robust tools that measure how well major employers are doing in fostering economic mobility for workers and how they could do better.
<br/><br/>
I worked on the entire frontend part of the application .

Design was done by one of the best information visualization designers I've had experience working with: [Piero Zagami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierozagami/) and [Alli Torban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisontorban/).

Project became The Webby Awards [winner](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/employment/249474/the-american-opportunity-index) in employments category.
