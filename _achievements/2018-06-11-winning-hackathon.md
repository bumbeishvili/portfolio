&nbsp;&nbsp; This visualization represents 300'000 Georgians who were enlisted in World War Two. Unfortunately, their families lost them in the the war and their descendants may even don't know anything about them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Georgians are only one mouse click away to find their lost ancestors with all other information about them.


You can see more details about the project [in this post](https://davidb.tech/project/geohistory)
